This is a small Single Page App that shows theme park data (park list, ride availability, and a calendar view with average wait times).

Quick start:

1. npm install
2. npm run dev
3. Open http://localhost:5173

Features:

- Home page with list of theme parks
- Park details page that shows today's date, attractions open / total and average wait time right now
- Calendar view with average wait times per day for the selected month and month navigation

This app uses React + Vite + TypeScript and mock data in `src/data/parks.ts`.
